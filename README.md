  <h1>Hospital App</h1>
  <p>The Hospital App offers a comprehensive platform for healthcare management, providing a flexible and user-friendly interface for patients, doctors, nurses, and HR management. It streamlines appointment scheduling, medical record access, data recording, and employee data management, including salary processing.</p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Appointment scheduling for patients and doctors</li>
    <li>Easy access to medical records</li>
    <li>Efficient data recording and management</li>
    <li>Comprehensive HR management module for employee data and salaries</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>This app is developed with Kotlin and utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for a modular and maintainable codebase. LiveData is used for data observation, Retrofit for network operations, and Room for database interactions. Dependency Injection is achieved through Hilt, while Coroutines and Coroutine Flow handle asynchronous tasks and data streams. Databinding simplifies the binding of UI components to data sources, and animations enhance the user experience. The Navigation component manages in-app navigation seamlessly.</p>
  
  <h3>MVVM</h3>
  <p>MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It is an architectural pattern that separates the user interface (view) from the business logic (model), with the ViewModel acting as an intermediary. This separation facilitates easier testing and maintenance.</p>
  
  <h3>LiveData</h3>
  <p>LiveData is a lifecycle-aware data holder class that enables the app to react to data changes without causing memory leaks or crashes.</p>
  
  <h3>Retrofit</h3>
  <p>Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android and Java, which simplifies the process of connecting to a web service.</p>
  
  <h3>Room</h3>
  <p>Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite that provides a robust database access mechanism while harnessing the full power of SQLite.</p>
  
  <h3>Hilt</h3>
  <p>Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the process of injecting dependencies into your app, making it more scalable and testable.</p>
  
  <h3>Coroutines</h3>
  <p>Kotlin Coroutines simplify asynchronous programming by turning asynchronous callbacks into sequential code, making the code more readable and maintainable.</p>
  
  <h3>Coroutine Flow</h3>
  <p>Coroutine Flow is a type of stream that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to a single value, and is built on top of Kotlin Coroutines.</p>
  
  <h3>Databinding</h3>
  <p>Databinding allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format, reducing boilerplate code.</p>
  
  <h3>Animation</h3>
  <p>Animations provide visual feedback to the users on their interactions with the app, making the experience more engaging and intuitive.</p>
  
  <h3>Navigation Component</h3>
  <p>The Navigation component helps manage app navigation and ensures a consistent and predictable user experience.</p>
